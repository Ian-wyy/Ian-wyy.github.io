I am a dual-degree undergraduate in Mechanical Engineering (SJTU) and Computer Science (UMich). My research focuses on multi-robot planning and learning-based control. I'm currently working with Prof. [Zhongqiang Ren](https://rap-lab.github.io/team/zren/) at [RAP Lab](https://rap-lab.github.io/) of Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

I am actively looking for research internships during my junior and senior years, and Ph.D. opportunities beginning in Fall 2027.
